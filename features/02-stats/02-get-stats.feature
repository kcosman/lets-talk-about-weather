Feature: Get measurement statistics
  In order to understand trends of measurements
  I want to be able to get statistics over specified periods of time

  Background:
    Given I have submitted new measurements as follows:
      | timestamp                  | temperature | dewPoint |
      | "2015-09-01T16:00:00.000Z" | 27.1        | 16.9     |
      | "2015-09-01T16:10:00.000Z" | 27.3        |          |
      | "2015-09-01T16:20:00.000Z" | 27.5        | 17.1     |
      | "2015-09-01T16:30:00.000Z" | 27.4        | 17.3     |
      | "2015-09-01T16:40:00.000Z" | 27.2        |          |
      | "2015-09-01T17:00:00.000Z" | 28.1        | 18.3     |

  Scenario: Handle bad from/to timestamps in the request to get stats for a well-reported metric
    # GET /stats?<params...>
    When I get stats with parameters:
      | param        | value                    |
      | stat         | min                      |
      | stat         | max                      |
      | stat         | average                  |
      | metric       | temperature              |
      | fromDateTime | 2015-09-01T17:00:00.000Z |
      | toDateTime   | 2015-09-01T16:00:00.000Z |
    Then the response has a status code of 400
